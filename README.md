<h1> Landing-Page-project </h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is just a simple project made to practice CSS.</p>
<p>The activity is sourced from The Odin Project's landing page activity template.</p>
<h3>Personal Notes</h3>
<ul>
    > I wanted to test how familiar I was with CSS and HTML in addition to how much I can recall from the lessons I learned.
    The simple images were made by me to avoid spending too much time on finding a suitable image that fitted the website.
    I also learned a couple of new things along the way for instance, sticky navbars.
</p>
<p>
    > The amount of CSS code utilized could use some work to avoid redundancy and improve simplicity. Also, learning
    learning responsive web design is a must in the future (the page was designed with monitors in mind).

<p>Criticisms and comments are appreciated. Do let me know what you think and what I can improve on.</p>
