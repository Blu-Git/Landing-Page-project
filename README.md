# Landing-Page-project

## Description
This is just a simple project made to practice CSS.
The activity is sourced from The Odin Project's landing page activity template.

### Personal Notes

* I wanted to test how familiar I was with CSS and HTML in addition to how much I can recall from the lessons I learned. 
 
* The simple images were made by me to avoid spending too much time on finding a suitable image that fitted the website. I also learned a couple of new things along the way, for instance, sticky navbars.
    
* The amount of CSS code utilized could use some work to avoid redundancy and improve simplicity. Also, learning responsive web design is a must in the future (the page was designed with monitors in mind.
